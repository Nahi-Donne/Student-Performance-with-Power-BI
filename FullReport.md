##### **5. Effect of Lunch on Performance**

###### **MATH**



**Summary Insight**



The math score distribution is roughly normal, but with a slight left skew —meaning most students perform moderately to well, with fewer very low scores.

Students with a standard lunch generally achieve higher math scores, with strong representation in the 60–90 range.

In contrast, students receiving free/reduced lunch are more concentrated in the lower to mid score ranges (30–70), suggesting that lunch type—and likely underlying socioeconomic factors—may be linked to performance differences in math.



###### **READING**



**Summary Insight**



The reading score distribution follows an approximately normal pattern. Students with a standard lunch tend to achieve higher reading scores, with most of them scoring between 50 and 90. On the other hand, those receiving free or reduced lunch are more concentrated in the lower to upper mid score ranges (40–80). This suggests that lunch type—possibly reflecting socioeconomic differences—may slightly be associated with variations in reading performance.



###### **WRITING**



**Summary Insight**



Here’s a smoother and more natural rewording of your paragraph:

The writing score distribution appears roughly normal. Students with a standard lunch generally perform better, with most scoring between 50 and 90. In contrast, those receiving free or reduced lunch are more concentrated in the lower to upper-mid range (around 40–80). This pattern suggests that lunch type—possibly reflecting underlying socioeconomic factors—may be modestly linked to differences in writing performance.



##### **6. Impact of Test Preparation course**



Students who completed the test preparation course tend to have higher math scores overall, as their distribution skews slightly toward the higher end compared to those who did not complete it.

Across all subjects, students who completed the test prep course scored 6–7 points higher on average.

This supports what we saw in the distribution chart — that completion correlates with stronger academic performance, especially at the higher score ranges.

Although most students (64%) did not complete the test preparation course, those who did complete it achieved higher average scores in math, reading, and writing.



The distribution chart reinforces this by showing that students who completed the course tend to cluster at higher math, reading and writing scores, indicating that the test preparation course has a positive impact on performance, even though fewer students participated in it.
